# Classification Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a classification analysis workflow using a dataset named `train.csv`. The analysis includes data exploration, visualization, and the implementation of classification models.

## Contents

- **Classification.ipynb**: The main notebook that walks through the classification analysis step by step.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you'll need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn` (if used later for modeling)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Load the Data**: The notebook begins by loading the `train.csv` dataset.
2. **Explore the Data**: Initial steps include checking the dataset's shape, viewing the first few rows, and understanding the data types.
3. **Visualize the Data**: Various plots are created to visualize the relationships between features.
4. **Classification Model**: The notebook eventually leads to the implementation of a classification model (details depend on further content).
